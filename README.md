# Java Calculator — Archive (Rebuild in Progress)

This repository documents one of the most important early projects in my growth as a developer.  
The original code is stored on an older backup drive and is currently being recovered.  
Once located, the full project (including the GUI version) will be uploaded here.

## 📌 About This Project

Even though the source files are not yet available, this calculator represents several major milestones in my development journey:

- My first **self-designed graphical user interface**
- My first time taking a small class assignment and expanding it into a **real application**
- A major step in learning how to **plan**, **refactor**, and **debug** larger codebases

## 🛠️ What the Project Included

- Command-line calculator  
- Custom Java GUI with buttons, a display panel, and error validation  
- Multiple rewrites as I improved the design  
- Clean separation between UI components and core logic  

---

## 🔧 Planned Updates

- Upload original project files once recovered  
- Rebuild a new version to compare progress over time  

---

## ⚠️ Note

If the original files cannot be recovered, I will recreate the project as **Version 2.0**, preserving the original design goals while updating it with my current skills.
